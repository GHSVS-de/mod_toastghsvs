# mod_toastghsvs for Joomla 3
- More for me and my projects than for anybody else. The easiest way to use it out-of-the-box is not to use it ;-)
- No luxury.
- Rudimentary code. I would say you need a custom template override. Helpful?: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/toasts/
- Displays a Bootstrap 5 toast in module position.
- but doesn't load BS 5 CSS/JS for you. Just fires the toast init script in layout default.php.
- You can set a time intervall (Cookie and Session based) when to display the toast again.
